## Styling Approach
I used simple CSS to make the blog look nice and clear. The blog list has a light background, and each blog post has rounded corners and a shadow for depth. When you hover over a post, it slightly grows and shows a bigger shadow. The design adjusts to fit smaller screens.

## New Features
BlogList.css is added
